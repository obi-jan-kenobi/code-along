# Function composition
Function composition is a type of higher-order function that allows
us to combine functions such that the result of applying one function
gets passed to the next function as an argument.

    (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c

Example:

    negate . sum $ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

We need the '$' because function call has higher precedence than '.' operator. Which means that without '$' it would be 

    negate . sum [1,2,3,4,5]
    negate . 15
